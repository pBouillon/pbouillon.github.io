        Since 2018, I have been working professionally as a Fullstack Software
        Engineer, creating platforms from the ground up. My experience spans the
        entire development process, including database design, backend
        development, and client-side application implementation.

      <p class="mb-4">
        I'm trying to stay involve in tech beyond my regular tasks by conducting
        technical interviews, writing

          >moderating Angular content</a

        and, more recently started, to write a book for beginners in this
        technology.

        When I'm not coding, you will likely find me exploring remote places to
        enjoy nature, trekking with an overly heavy backpack, or learning
        useless (yet fascinating) facts.
