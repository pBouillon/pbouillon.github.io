## Hi, I'm Pierre Bouillon üëã

I'm a young french software engineer, passionate about new technologies,
programming and sharing what I managed to learn along the way.

I'm mostly into programming and software architecture, also curious
about IoT and functional programming.

I love making things work, usually using Python or C#, mostly fueled with
optimism, enthusiasm and coffee. ‚òï

You can find more about my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/pbouillon) !

I'm always keen to learn new languages, technologies or else. However, here

## Achievements

üèÜ Big or small, here are some of my achievements that I'm proud of !

- **[MQTTTopicBuilder](https://github.com/pBouillon/MqttTopicBuilder) creator**  
  With over 1.5K downloads, this C# library aims to provide a robust way for
  developer to handle MQTT topics in an OOP way instead of raw values
- **[Bourse Coddity 2020](https://bourse.coddity.com/) winner**  
  Along with a friend of mine I built from the ground a
  RESTful API and the associated front-ends to help teachers organize virtual
  workshops for teenagers organized around tech topics such as the security,
  raising awareness, etc.
- **[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) 2019 and 2020 organizer**  
  With the help of my engineering school, I organized my home town's first
  Hacktoberfest hub. Managing the local event, I was also a speaker to help
  newcomers to dive into the Open Source software and get started with git.
