## Hi, I'm Pierre Bouillon 👋

I'm a young french software engineer, passionate about new technologies,
programming and sharing what I managed to learn along the way.

I'm mostly into programming and software architecture, also curious
about IoT and functional programming.

I love making things work, usually using Python or C#, mostly fueled with
optimism, enthusiasm and coffee. ☕

You can find more about my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/pbouillon) !

## Achievements 🏆

Big or small, here are some of my achievements that I'm proud of !

### MQTTTopicBuilder creator

With around **2.8K downloads**, this C# library aims to provide a robust way for
developer to handle MQTT topics in an OOP way instead of raw values.

### Bourse Coddity 2021 winner

Along with another student of my school, we built an ecosystem of tools around
fake-news prevention. On the top of a RESTful API, we created a front-end,
a micro-service and a browser extension to allow users to rate the medias
based on their trustfulness and assign them a trust index.

### Bourse Coddity 2020 winner

Along with a friend of mine I built from the ground a
RESTful API and the associated front-ends to help teachers organize virtual
workshops for teenagers organized around tech topics such as the security,
raising awareness, etc.

### Hacktoberfest organizer (2019 & 2020)

With the help of my engineering school, I organized my home town's first
Hacktoberfest hub. Managing the local event, I was also a speaker to help
newcomers to dive into the Open Source software and get started with git and
GitHub.
