## Hi, I'm Pierre Bouillon

I'm a french software engineer, passionate about new technologies,
programming and sharing what I managed to learn along the way.

I'm mostly into programming and software architecture, also curious
about IoT and functional programming.

I love making things work, usually using Python or C#, mostly fueled with
optimism, enthusiasm and coffee. â˜•

You can find more about my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/pbouillon).

## Achievements

### MQTTTopicBuilder creator

With around **3.3K downloads**, this C# library aims to provide a robust way for
developer to handle MQTT topics in an OOP way instead of raw values by enforcing
the various constraints that a topic must respect.

{{< highlight "c#" >}}
// Creating a topic as "Hello/From/Mqtt/Topic/Builder/#"
var subscribeTo = new TopicBuilder(TopicConsumer.Subscriber)
    .AddTopic("Hello")
    .AddTopic("From")
    .AddTopics("Mqtt", "Topic", "Builder")
    .AddMultiLevelWildcard()
    .Build();

var topic = Topic.FromString("Hello/World");  // or (Topic) "Hello/World";
Console.WriteLine(topic.Value);   // -> "Hello/World"
Console.WriteLine(topic.Levels);  // -> 2

### Bourse Coddity 2021 winner

Along with another student of my school, we built an ecosystem of tools around
fake-news prevention. On the top of a RESTful API, we created a front-end,
a micro-service and a browser extension to allow users to rate the medias
based on their trustfulness and assign them a trust index.

### Bourse Coddity 2020 winner

Along with a friend of mine I built from the ground a
RESTful API and the associated front-ends to help teachers organize virtual
workshops for teenagers organized around tech topics such as the security,
raising awareness, etc.

### Hacktoberfest organizer (2019 & 2020)

With the help of my engineering school, I organized my home town's first
Hacktoberfest hub. Managing the local event, I was also a speaker to help
newcomers to dive into the Open Source software and get started with git and
GitHub.
